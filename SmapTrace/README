===========================================================================

This is a windbg plugin which is a PoC implementation of the idea 
disclosed at H2HC 2018 talk "SMAPwn: a faster way for detecting double 
fetch vulnerabilities in Windows kernel" (available at:
https://github.com/h2hconference/2018/blob/master/H2HC%20-%20Artem%20Shishkin%20-%20SMAPwn.pptx ).


How to build
===========================================================================

Open "SmapTrace.sln" file in Visual Studio 2017 then use
"Build solution" button in Visual Studio 2017.

Notes
===========================================================================
Please disable KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation) before using this plugin.
In order to do so, you may use cmd.exe as Administrator with the following commands:
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management" /v FeatureSettingsOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management" /v FeatureSettingsOverrideMask /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f


What does it do?
===========================================================================

This plugin enables SMAP feature on CPU cores (Supported on BDW+).
It also implements custom page fault and debug trap / fault 
handlers for Windows kernel. The page fault handler filters SMAP 
related events and logs them to the attached kernel debugger. 
Custom debug handler is used to automatically resume target execution
after logging the SMAP related event.

The idea is to track kernel mode accesses to user memory using SMAP. 
For further details refer to the H2HC 2018 presentation.

Usage
===========================================================================

.load <path>\SmapTrace.dll
!trfilter - set the module that is going to be tracked ("nt" by default)
!trauto - start tracing in automatic mode
!trman - start tracing in manual mode
!trnext - resume until next SMAP event in manual mode
!trstop - stop tracing
.unload <path>\SmapTrace.dll
