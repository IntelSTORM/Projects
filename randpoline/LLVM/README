What does the LLVM Patch do?
===========================================================================

The patch makes the LLVM toolchain capable of understing the following
parameters:

(i) "-mllvm -enable-randpoline=load": reserves R13 and initializes it in the
beginning of program execution to hold a random entry for a R11 thunk. All
forward indirect branches are converted into the randpoline form, using the
thunk as a trampoline for reaching the function intended in the control-flow.

(ii) "-mllvm -enable-randpoline=dynamic": does not reserve R13. Instead,
generates a new thunk index on every forward indirect branch and use it to reach
the function intended in the control-flow. Uses R10 and R11.

(iii) "-mllvm -enable-randpoline=preserv": does not instrument the binary with
the mitigation. Only reserves R13. Meant to be used for compiling libraries.

How to apply the patch?
===========================================================================
cd /tmp
wget http://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/llvm-9.0.0.src.tar.xz
tar -xvf llvm-9.0.0.src.tar.xz
patch -p1 < 0001-Randpoline-mitigation.patch

then build LLVM as desired :)
