- There are multiple possibilities to implement Randpoline, we've chosen one of them, be sure to read the whitepaper 
for more information on drawbacks and advantages

- The current implementation does not support 32-bits binaries and is not compatible with older versions of GCC (read 
the README file for information on versions tested)

- In certain corner cases of indirect branches, the current implementation of the plugin cannot apply a mitigation. 
In such cases a compiler warning will be issued.  

- The Removereg supporting plugin will only stop GCC from allocating r13 at compile time, inline assembly using r13
will require manual fixing.
