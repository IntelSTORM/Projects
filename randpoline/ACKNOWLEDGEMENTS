We got a lot of inspiration and learned a lot about gcc internals by reviewing code by Emese Revfy 
(https://github.com/ephox-gcc-plugins) and researchers from Columbia University 
(https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~vpk/research/kguard/).  

We are most grateful for feedback we received through peer review from community members.

We really appreciate the community sharing and hope others can also benefit from this work.
